# Attendance_handler
# These MATLAB code files were created to extract the information of the present and absent students from the Microsoft Teams attendance list
# The "importfile_attendance_file.m" file imports data from a csv file containing the Microsoft Teams attendance list
# The other two files use the imported data to create the customized attendance list for two courses - IPE 481 & IPE 303
