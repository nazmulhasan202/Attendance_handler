# Attendance_handler
# These MATLAB code files were created to extract the information of the present and absent students from the Microsoft Teams attendance list
# The "importfile_attendance_file.m" file imports data from a csv file containing the Microsoft Teams attendance list
# The two ".mlx" files use the imported data and compare those against previously prepared "Table" containing the student information (ID and name) to create customized attendance list for two courses - IPE 481 & IPE 303
